# Force-Directed-Graph-Drawing

Some of the most flexible algorithms for calculating layouts of simple undirected graphs
belong to a class known as force-directed algorithms.<br> Also known as spring embedders,<br>
such algorithms calculate the layout of a graph using only information contained within<br>
the structure of the graph itself, rather than relying on domain-specific knowledge.<br> Graphs
drawn with these algorithms tend to be aesthetically pleasing, exhibit symmetries, and tend
to produce crossing-free layouts for planar graphs
